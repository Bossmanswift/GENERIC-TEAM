Please visit our Board @ https://github.com/Bossmanswift/GENERIC-TEAM/projects/1

There are 5 columns: 
1) Unassigned
  Unassigned are issues that we have yet to addressed or issues we noticed during development of other issues.
 
2) To do
  To do are issues that are assigned to Developers and in hopes that they get that done. If they are unaware where to start,
  please select an issue that is assigned to you and talk to other team members for pointers.

3) In Progress
  These are issues that are currently being worked on by the Developers.

4) In Review
  These are issues that are currently in progress of being reviewed by the Team as a Pull Request

5) Done
  Thank you for contributing.
  
** At anytime when you see an issue, please do not dive right into the solution.
    Create a issue under Unassigned and the development team will have a look.
    As it may already be worked on by another Developer.
   
Commit -
  You will notice that every Issue has a unique identifier. When working on an issue, when you are ready to commit,
  please add this issue number as the first thing to your commit, then your commit message.
  
  Example: I am working on Issue #41
  After I am done working on this issue, I want to commit it so the following command that gets executed is:
    git commit -m "#41 Added student file"

Pull Request -
  For rights to merge into the master branch, please add all Developers to your Pull Request.
  When you have 2 approvals, you may merge your changes into the master branch.
